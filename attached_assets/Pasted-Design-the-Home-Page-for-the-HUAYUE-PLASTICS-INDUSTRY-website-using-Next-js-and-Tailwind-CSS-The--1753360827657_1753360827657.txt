Design the Home Page for the “HUAYUE PLASTICS INDUSTRY” website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The hero section should be a fullscreen, responsive slider (carousel) that captures the brand's modern, eco-conscious identity with the following specifications:

Text overlay per slide:

Large headline (e.g., “INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS”)

Subtext or supporting line (e.g., “Delivering quality plastic products worldwide”)

Call-to-Action (CTA) button (e.g., “View Products”, “Explore Now”) that links to /products

Navigation arrows and dot indicators to slide between hero sections

Auto-slide (optional) every 5–7 seconds with manual control

Fade or sliding animation between slides for smooth transitions

Accessible design with ARIA labels and proper alt text
